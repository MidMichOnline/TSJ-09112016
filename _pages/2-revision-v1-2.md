Please join us if you are interested in learning more about the Early College program. We are looking to enroll current 11th grade students for our 2nd Cohort. 11th grade students will have until the end of September to make a decision to enroll in the Early College program. <br style="clear: both;" />If you are a sophomore and/or a freshman in school, then you still have some time to learn more about the Early College program. <br style="clear: both;" />If you are unable to attend, then please make arrangements to get information from the counseling office.

> Picture day will be on September 15th, beginning at 8:00 am. If a student has morning votech, they will need to report to the high school auxiliary gym no later than 7:40 am to have their picture taken before they leave to board the bus.
Picture packets, and options, are available for viewing and payment online at www.geskusphoto.com.
Students were handed an order form the first day of school. If they need another one, please have them stop by the office.
Photographers will not be able to make change, so if you are paying in cash you will need the exact amount.
